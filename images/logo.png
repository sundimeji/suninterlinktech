This is a placeholder for the PNG logo file.

To create the actual PNG logo:
1. Open the logo.svg file in a web browser or image editor
2. Export/save it as PNG format
3. Replace this file with the actual PNG image

Alternatively, you can use the SVG logo directly in your HTML by changing the image source to "images/logo.svg"
